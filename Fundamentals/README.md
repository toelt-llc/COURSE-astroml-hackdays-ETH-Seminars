# Fundamentals

In this folder you will find material and lectures that can help you while learning how neural networks works (theoretically and practically).

## Neural Networks

You can find an introduction to Neural Networks in the slides for a lecture given by Umberto Michelucci at the ETH. They are google slides and should be 
accessible online easily.

## Examples

If you know a bit of Python you can get your hands dirty with a very basic examples of image classification and Keras with this Jupyter notebook (it will open
itself in Google Colab, so no need to download or install anything)
