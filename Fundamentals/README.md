# Fundamentals

In this folder you will find material and lectures that can help you while learning how neural networks works (theoretically and practically).

## Tools

In the file [Introduction_to_Jupyter_Colab_GitHub.pdf](https://github.com/toelt-llc/astroml-hackdays/blob/master/Fundamentals/Introduction_to_Jupyter_Colab_GitHub.pdf) that you can find in this folder, you can find a ver good introduction to Google Colab and what are Jupyter notebook by Michela Sperti.

## Neural Networks

- You can find an introduction to Neural Networks in the slides for a lecture given by Umberto Michelucci at the ETH. They are google slides and should be 
accessible online easily.

- At this repository in GitHub you can find the complete material of a course given by Umberto Michelucci at the University of Applied Science in ZÃ¼rich in 2019. Note that the code is still a mixture of TensorFlow 1.x and 2.x (at the time TensorFlow 2.X was not as mature as now).

- A Github repository (by Umberto Michelucci) on how to approach TensorFlow 2.X. Here you can find how to study it, various examples and code that you can study and
try yourself.

## Examples

If you know a bit of Python you can get your hands dirty with a very basic examples of image classification and Keras with this Jupyter notebook (it will open
itself in Google Colab, so no need to download or install anything)
