# Image Enhancing

This material focus on the use of neural networks for doing image enhancing. But for an overview of classical image processing techniques you can check this [BLOG post](https://towardsdatascience.com/image-enhancement-techniques-using-opencv-and-python-9191d5c30d45), or any good book about image processing.

## Slides

You can find the slides on the topic of classification here

Neural style transfer is not, stricly speaking, an image enhancing method, but it shows very well how to use the specific loss functions (style for example) to extract and compare specific information about an image.
